# Arduino_redar
VCC -5V 
GND-GND PIN 
TRIG -2 
ECHO-3 
Then next I connected the servo motor as follows:- 
RED wire - 5V 
BROWN wire- GND 
ORANGE - 4 
Once all the connections were done I stick the ultrasonic sensor on the servo motor with a glue gun (it doesn't stay for long but is great as a temporary solution) 
Moving forward with the coding part I created a function to measure the distance from the sensor and then inside a loop I gave command to rotate the servo motor from left to $ right. $ 
In the Processing IDE simply open the code for radar  and mention the PORT name and then run the program. 
Try bringing an object near the sensor and you will see a difference in the pattern of the radar
